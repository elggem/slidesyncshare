    # Motivation
      - In a student teacher videoconference, there are many ways to synchronize slides between participants, in a shared experience and unified learning environment.
      - SlideSyncShare: A synchronized and interactive presentation for multiple participants, embedded side-by-side a real-time videoconference.
      - Can be embedded into a learning management system using LTI.
      - No screen sharing with video encoding like Zoom! Instead, local rendering of slides, and synchronisation between participants.

    # Our use cases
      - *Shared presentation:* The lecturer controls which slide is currently being shown to the students.
      - *Interactive polls:* Students participate in a poll and results are synchronized with the group.
      - *Interactive Quizzes:* Students participate in quizzes and results will only be shared with the lecturer and after completion.
