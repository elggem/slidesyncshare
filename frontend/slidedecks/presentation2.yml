    # Motivation
      - In a videoconference, there are many ways to synchronize slides between the presenter and participants.
      - We propose SlideSyncShare: A synchronized and interactive presentation tool that is locally rendered and embedded next to a real-time videoconference.
      - Integration with learning management systems using the learning tools interoperability (LTI) standard.

    # Our use cases
      - *Shared presentation:* The lecturer controls which slide is currently being shown to the students.
      - *Interactive polls:* Students participate in a poll and results are synchronized with the group.
      - *Interactive Quizzes:* Students participate in quizzes and results will only be shared with the lecturer and after completion.

    # Frontend
      - We considered using PDF.js for rendering the slidedecks but have switched to rendering them from a YAML file.
      - This allows for better integration of interactive polls and quizzes.
      - Markdown rendering is very flexible and allows for embedded HTML as well.

    # LTI Integration
      - PyLTI and Flask are used for the integration.
      - We can add our tool into Moodle and we have basic user authentication.
      - In the future we will use this user authentication to display independent views for lecturer and students.
